This is actually just [Base16 Ocean Dark](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean), which can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2/master/base16-ocean.dark.itermcolors). I'm leaving this repository up in case it's being depended on by somebody somewhere – but it's fundamentally useless.
